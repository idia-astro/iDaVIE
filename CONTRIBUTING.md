# Contributing to the i-DaVIE-v project

Thank you for your interest in helping i-DaVIE-v become better. We gladly accept contributions from anyone, whether it is a bug fix or a new feature.

## Getting started
There are several ways to contribute to the development of i-DaVIE-v.
### Issues
#### Create a new issue
If you find an error with i-DaVIE-v (e.g., the program crashing, data not loading, or incorrect behaviour), [check if a similar issue already exists](https://github.com/idia-astro/idia_unity_vr/issues). If a relevant issue does not exist already, create a new issue using one of the [relevant templates]().

#### Fixing an issue
If you would like to add a feature or fix a bug yourself, feel free to look through our [existing issues](https://github.com/idia-astro/idia_unity_vr/issues) to find one that interests you. In particular, issues in the ["Icebox"](https://github.com/orgs/idia-astro/projects/2/views/1?filterQuery=Icebox) are considered nice to haves but low priority. You can also filter the issues by `Label`, and we recommend issues labeled with "good first issue" for developers just getting started. Once you complete your work, please open a pull request following the [pull request template]() and we'll integrate your fix into future releases of i-DaVIE-v.

Before you start developing, please take a look at the following resources:
* Installing Unity and recommended development environment
* Getting started with Unity
* Building i-DaVIE-v from source
* i-DaVIE-v documentation
