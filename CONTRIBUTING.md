# Contributing to the iDaVIE-v project

Thank you for your interest in helping iDaVIE-v become better. We gladly accept contributions from anyone, whether it is a bug fix or a new feature.

## Getting started
There are several ways to contribute to the development of iDaVIE-v.
### Issues
#### Create a new issue
If you find an error with iDaVIE-v (e.g., the program crashing, data not loading, or incorrect behaviour), [check if a similar issue already exists](https://github.com/idia-astro/idia_unity_vr/issues). If a relevant issue does not exist already, create a new issue using one of the [relevant templates]().

#### Request a feature
If you have an idea for a new feature you feel is missing from iDaVIE-v, feel free to open a new issue using the feature request [template](). The development team will evaluate its feasibility, and assign it a priority on the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/idia-astro/projects/2/views/1) depending on the likely difficulty of implementing it. Of course, nothing prevents you from adding the feature yourself.

#### Fixing an issue
If you would like to add a feature or fix a bug yourself, feel free to look through our [existing issues](https://github.com/idia-astro/idia_unity_vr/issues) to find one that interests you. In particular, issues in the ["Icebox"](https://github.com/orgs/idia-astro/projects/2/views/1?filterQuery=Icebox) are considered nice to haves but low priority. You can also filter the issues by `Label`, and we recommend issues labeled with [`"good first issue"`](https://github.com/idia-astro/idia_unity_vr/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) for developers just getting started with iDaVIE-v. Once you complete your work, please open a pull request following the [pull request template]() and we'll integrate your fix into future releases of iDaVIE-v.

#### Pull request etiquette
1. Make sure to test a compiled version of the program before submitting a pull request, not just the version in the Unity Editor.
2. Make sure to add documentation in the code that you wrote – we will not accept pull requests that lack documentation.
3. Make sure to clearly list the changes you've made and why – detailed reasoning make it more likely that the pull request will be accepted.
